# Predictive Linguistic Interaction Model (PLIM)


## Overview

The **Predictive Linguistic Interaction Model (PLIM)** represents an innovative approach at the intersection of **educational technology**, **environmental health**, and **neuroeducation**. This repository provides the tools and framework for integrating **EEG data**, spatiotemporal modeling, and graph-based interaction learning into the field of English education. The ultimate goal is to enhance the understanding of **classroom cognitive dynamics**, improve engagement prediction, and optimize learning outcomes.

By incorporating the **Behavioral Adaptation Strategy for English Learning (BASEL)**, this framework delivers actionable, personalized interventions based on dynamic predictions. The work emphasizes the importance of contextual and environmental factors in education, creating a bridge between **public health research** and **language learning optimization**.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Linguistic Interaction Model (PLIM):**
  - A hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture that captures:
    - **Temporal dependencies** in classroom interactions.
    - **Peer collaboration dynamics** using graph-based modeling.
    - **Contextual embeddings** to account for classroom environments.
  - Integrates multimodal data, including **EEG signals**, spatiotemporal classroom data, and linguistic interactions.

- **Behavioral Adaptation Strategy for English Learning (BASEL):**
  - Translates predictions into **adaptive interventions** tailored to individual students.
  - Ensures improved engagement and optimized educational outcomes.

- **Empirical Validation:**
  - Demonstrates PLIM's superiority over baseline models in predicting engagement and improving learning outcomes.

This work reinforces the connection between **environmental health** and **neuroeducation**, highlighting the cognitive impacts of classroom environments and providing a foundation for educational frameworks informed by emerging interdisciplinary research.
